# Student-Teacher-Problem
It's a project based on concept of operating system

Two types of people can enter into a library- students and teachers. After entering the library, the visitor searches for the required 
books and gets them. In order to get them issued, he goes to the single CPU which is there to process the issuing of books. Two types of 
queues are there at the counter-one for students and one for teachers. A student goes and stands at the tail of the queue for students 
and similarly the teacher goes and stands at the tail of the queue for teachers (FIFO). If a student is being serviced and a teacher
arrives at the counter, he would be the next person to get service (PRIORITY-non preemptive). If two teachers arrive at the same time,
they will stand in their queue to get service (FIFO). WAP to ensure that the system works in a non-chaotic manner. â€¢ If a teacher is being
served and during the period when he is being served, another teacher comes, then that teacher would get the service next. This process
might continue leading to increase in waiting time of students. Ensure in your program that the waiting time of students is minimized.
